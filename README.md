Water Potability Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting water potability (suitability for human consumption) based on various water quality parameters using a machine learning approach. The dataset consists of measurements such as pH levels, water hardness, dissolved solids, and other key indicators that help determine whether water is safe for drinking.

1. Business Understanding
The objective is to assess water quality and predict its potability, making it suitable for applications in water treatment planning, environmental monitoring, and ensuring compliance with water quality standards. The project aims to help water treatment plants, environmental agencies, and researchers make informed decisions regarding the safety of water for consumption.
